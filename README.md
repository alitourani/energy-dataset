# Energy Consumption Dataset

### ⚠️ The repository is under development and will be updated gradually ⚠️

This repository contains a dataset of generated instances according to real-world values. The dataset holds time of the day, temperature, wind speed, and humidity. The main goal of introducing such dataset is to produce a real dataset for deep learning approaches.
